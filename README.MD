# Clock for Virtual Box
## Get Time Zone/Clock while in a VBOX

### What?!

When using a virtual box set up with different time-zone, IP etc.., just run this program in terminal to get local time zone, or run a clock in your terminal with your real location's time.


This is particularly useful to me, since I have kali linux as my daily bare-metal system, but do most "normal user" activities through a Virtual Box in an entirely different time zone.

### Oh...

To run:

1) Run in terminal as usual
2) Use the appropriate command-line arguments, or type ```python3 main.py --help```
3) Run the clock with ```python3 main.py --clock``` if you have a previously stored time zone.
